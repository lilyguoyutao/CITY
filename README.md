# CITY
CITY is short for Connecting Idea Threads of Youth (CITY)

Design and develop an education system website named “Connecting Idea Threads of Youth(CITY)” using Spring MVC framework. Project address: http://tccl.rit.albany.edu:8080/example/

“CITY” is an interactive system for teachers to build communities based on students’ class, grade, etc.
Within each community, teachers are allowed to post different class projects or threads for students to study and exchange their ideas.

“CITY" project includes the following functions: building communities, adding new projects or threads to a community, browsing projects or threads, following project’s update, searching projects or threads based on keywords, making a comment and collecting idea threads.

A recommendation system using “cosine similarities” and “natural language processing” is incorporated to “CITY” in order to automatically recommend the related projects or threads to students based on their browsing history or interest.
